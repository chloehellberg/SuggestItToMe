## üåê About the Project

### üìñ Description


- Inspiration Behind Project:
  - When I was in college I registered for an English class expecting to read the classics but isntead got an entire course devoted to utopian/dystopian science fiction. I expected to hate it and drop since I had never read any sci-fi in my life - no one had ever suggested this particular genre to me before. Of course what ended up happening was an awakening and science fiction is now counted as one of my favorite genres and thus the catalyst for this project.
- Project Purpose or Goal:
  - What I love most about reading is that I can dive into perspectives of all different kinds of people and types of places and hopefully gain better understanding of others who aren't me. It's not helpful though when the only books suggested to me keep me in the same lane and don't allow me to expand my horizons. I'm also tired of having my Google footprint follow me around wherever I go and determine what I may like or not based on my previous experiences. I'm setting out to build the opposite of a "Books Suggested For You" application - more of a, "Books Not Typically Suggested For You" website. Perhaps there is a book or genre out there that you've never considered and no one else has thought to suggest it to you either - until now!

### Capstone Proposal
- Name of Project: "Suggest It To Me" 

- MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
  - Users can go to a suggestion form, choose a few genres they typically like (ex. Historical Fiction, Adventure, Mystery) and product will spit out three book suggestions that doln't fall within those categories
  - Or, Users go to a suggestion form, choose a genre they would like to explore (ex. Historical Fiction, Adventure, Mystery) and how many books they would like suggested. On submit, form pulls the genre keyword and then spits out say Mystery novels that are all vastly different based on keywords.
  - Suggestion form may work as guided flow that splits off paths and goes one way or another depending on what was previously chosen. Rather than having a one page entry form.

- What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources that will be utilized to create the MVP:
  - Framework/Language: JavaScript/React/Redux
  - Google API for pulling book information

- If finished with MVP, additional features to work on:
  - Authorization/Authentication abilities
    * User will be able to keep track of books they've previously read (a bookshelf feature).
    * User will be able to continuously base their suggestions off of what they've previously read.
  - More than one suggestion at a time
    * User can choose how many book suggestions they want at a time rather than a static 3 options.
    * User also has ability to say "no" to a book and have another suggestion pop up.
  - User can enter books they've previously read on the form and will take those into consideration when suggesting books to read.
  - Add an option to choose book size/length as a parameter search. Additional filter options.

- What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs or other resources to achieve addtional features:
  - Goodreads API for pulling in previous books read.
  - Firebase if I add authorization/authentication features.

      * Text Editor - Open by double clicking on any of the files to open in a text editor.
  6) In the project directory (suggest-it-to-me), type `npm install` to download dependencies. After they install, type `npm start` to run the application in development mode.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. Page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
